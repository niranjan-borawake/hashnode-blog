This wasn't a typical Sunday morning. We were all on vacation and staying at our relatives. It all started when my 5-year-old son refused to eat breakfast. That isn't surprising, because it has been happening on a fairly frequent basis. But this time it was important for two reasons: first, he had skipped dinner the night before, and second, we were scheduled to return to our house, which would be an 8-hour drive. He would eat all the junk stuff in the car if he didn't have breakfast.

We also had my son's grandparents with us, which added to the fun. They were even more concerned because he hadn't been eating well for the past two days, contrary to their expectations.

I was eating my breakfast in the front yard, watching over my son as he played with the cat. His mother approached him and asked, sternly, "This is the first and last time I'm asking you. Do you want some *poha* to eat?"

"No.", he said, ignoring her while playing with the cat.
She walked away angrily. Since last night, she's been hearing his 'No.'

*Perhaps his grandfather inquired about his breakfast with his mum.*

"Baby, if you have poha, I'll give you my phone in the car and you can play your favourite game," his grandfather said tenderly. "Give me your phone now and I'll have poha once I finish playing the game," he replied, leaving the cat alone. His granddad had previous experience with this and understood it didn't work that way. He was sad when he returned.

*Perhaps his granny inquired of his grandfather*

Now, his grandma came to him and said, "Please finish your breakfast, baby; we've got a long way to go. After you finish your poha, I'll give you cookies." 
"Can I have some cookies now?", he asked. She, too, was sad when she left.

*My wife's aunt came over to see whether I needed any more poha.*

She too tried, "You didn't like the poha, did you? I've added a lot of sugar to it. Try it once. You will love it." He paid her no attention at all.

*A few more relatives arrived and tried, but nothing helped.*

While I ate my breakfast, I sat quietly watching them all do their best. Finally, my wife arrived, handed me his breakfast plate, and urged me to deal with him with her stare. 

When I was done, I approached him and said,
"Should we do a cat trick on everyone in the house?"

"Yes. What exactly is the trick? ", he replied with a huge laugh on his face.

"You should hide behind me and finish your breakfast. We'll tell everyone the poha was eaten by the cat."

"Yeah...!", he shouted with a smile on his face.

In the next ten minutes, he finished his breakfast.

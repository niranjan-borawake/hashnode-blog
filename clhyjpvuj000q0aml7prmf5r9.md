As parents, we often find ourselves engaging in the most fascinating conversations with our children. Recently, a simple question from my 6yo sparked a thought-provoking exchange that left me both amused and amazed.

It all began when a new book arrived from Amazon. I was excited to read it, but my son stopped me. "Why do you want to read a book, Dad?" he innocently asked. "You should be working on your laptop and earning money instead."

His question surprised me, but it opened the door to an important discussion. I explained to him that books are more than just words on a page. They can take us on adventures, spark our imagination, and help us learn new things.

My son's eyes lit up as he replied, "But Dad, if you earn more money, you can buy me lots of toys." His honesty made me smile, and I realized this was an opportunity to teach him about aspirations.

I suggested that he, too, could start reading and studying. By learning and working hard, he could earn money in the future. That way, he could buy toys for his baby.

To my surprise, he had an unexpected solution in mind. He eagerly said, "Dad, can you have another baby, please?". When asked why, "Toys, Dad!" he exclaimed joyfully. "My uncle gets me lots of toys. If you have another baby, my baby will have an uncle who would buy a lot of toys for my baby."

Children are incredibly creative problem solvers. Their fresh perspectives can inspire us to think differently and find unconventional solutions to challenges.

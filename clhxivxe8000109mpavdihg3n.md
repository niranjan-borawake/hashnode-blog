One day, I had a wonderful conversation with my 4yo son that took me by surprise. Out of the blue, my little boy told me that he did not want to grow old because he thought grown-ups are not loved or cared anymore. He believed that loving and caring meant kissing and hugging, and he had never seen me do that with his grandfather.

I realised that my son had an innocent misunderstanding, and I took the opportunity to explain to him that love and care can be expressed in many different ways, not just physical affection. It's about being there for someone when they need you, supporting them, and showing kindness and respect.

I shared some examples of how I show love and care to my own father, even though I don't hug or kiss him all the time. I help him with tasks around the house, and spend time talking and discussing things.

We ended our conversation with a hug.

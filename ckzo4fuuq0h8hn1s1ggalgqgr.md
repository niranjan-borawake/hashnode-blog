## Strange Interview Experience

This was my first time participating in a hiring drive.

All candidates were instructed to report to the Hiring Company's campus at 9:00 a.m. on a Saturday morning. I reached on time. The security guards asked me to write down my name and phone number at the gate. The receptionist asked me a few questions after I entered the building, and then she made me write my name and phone number again. I was then directed to the fourth floor.

The HR representative on the fourth floor asked me a few more questions and required me to write my name and phone number for the third time. I was then told to wait in a room. I joined the crowd of about 20 people who were already there. In the next hour, about 20 more people joined us, with only 4 or 5 leaving (for interview).

It was nearly 2:00 p.m. I'd been there for five hours and hadn't been called in for a single interview. I was shocked by the politeness of all the candidates who sat patiently on their chairs as if they would be shot if they moved. I was alone wandering in the room and corridor of the floor trying to find a newspaper or a magazine since my phone was low on battery. I could find none. Finally, I made an announcement in the room asking if anyone has a phone charger. I got one. But there wasn't any charging point in the room and I realised that it was a training room. I had to unplug some projector wires and charge my phone. Rest of them stared at me as if I was stealing electricity.

I was very hungry at this point, and it was then that I realised how angry hunger can make you. HR came in three times in 15 minutes, each time asking for a candidate, named Sameer, and checking to see if he was in the room.

The third time I couldn't help myself and called the HR as she was about to walk out the door.

> "Excuse me.", I shouted.

> "Yes."

> "Are you looking for Sameer?"

> "Yes. Are you Sameer?"

> "No. I'm not."

> "So? Do you need something?"

> "Yes. Do you know how many times I had to write my name and number to be here and wait in this room?"

> "Sorry."

> "Three times. I wrote my name and number three times. At the gate, then at the reception and then someone on this 4th floor made me write it again."

> "What's your problem?"

> "Don't you have Sameer's phone number. Why can't you call him. You came here 3 times asking for him. Can't you just call and check where he is."

> "Mmmm... yes, I'll do that.", said she, while rest of the candidates stared at us in surprise.

> "Thank you. And yes, when do you plan to call me for an interview?"

> "Your name, please."

> "Niranjan."

> "Ohh.. You are next.", she said while searching my name on a sheet of paper.

> "Thank you."

Note: Despite passing all of the interview rounds, I did not accept their offer.
